# Vanilla-Node-Rest-Api
Pure vanilla without the dependencies like express. This module helps build an understanding of the node system.
Express and these other tools offer a level of abstraction , and this might obscure the proper understanding required

# Dependencies used
I realise the irony in this , but still , a few modules were introduced into this project
nodemon [npm i -D nodemon]
uuid [npm i uuid]

# Need to Knows
In your package.json file , write the following scripts
    **"start": "node server.js"**,
    **"dev": "nodemon server.js"**
    
# Nota Bene
This is just barebones backend , frontend is not included but can be implemented with whatever framework you'd like
in your own project
